# Feature Specification: API Scaffold

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-api-scaffold`
**Created**: September 13, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create api scaffold, this is an api only, no frontend or mobile code."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A backend developer or system integrator needs a ready-to-use API scaffold to build and expose backend services. No frontend or mobile code is required.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project, **When** the API scaffold is generated, **Then** only backend API code and structure are present (no frontend/mobile code).
2. **Given** the scaffold, **When** a developer inspects the project, **Then** it is clear how to add new API endpoints and models.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a user tries to generate frontend or mobile code? The scaffold should simply ignore such requests; no error or warning is needed. This ensures agents do not generate any directory structure or files for frontend or mobile code.
- How does the scaffold handle different API styles? The scaffold is designed specifically for REST APIs.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a backend-only API scaffold.
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT include any frontend or mobile code.
- **FR-003**: Scaffold MUST provide clear structure for adding REST API endpoints.
- **FR-004**: Scaffold MUST provide a place for defining data models/entities.
- **FR-005**: Scaffold MUST include documentation or comments to guide backend developers.
- **FR-006**: Scaffold MUST support REST API style only.
- **FR-007**: Scaffold MUST include basic error handling structure.
- **FR-008**: Scaffold MUST be easily extensible for future backend features.

### Key Entities
- **API Endpoint**: Represents a route or handler for a backend service.
- **Data Model/Entity**: Represents the structure of data managed by the API.
