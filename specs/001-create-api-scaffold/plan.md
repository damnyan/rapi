# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]


**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust (latest stable, e.g., 1.75+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: actix-web (web framework), tokio (async runtime), serde (serialization), utoipa (OpenAPI doc generation), deadpool-postgres (Postgres pool), dotenvy (env config), thiserror (error handling), validator (validation)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (via deadpool-postgres)  
**Testing**: cargo test, actix-web test utilities, possible integration test harness  
**Target Platform**: Linux server, macOS, containerized (Docker)  
**Project Type**: single (API-only, all code in project/ directory)  
**Performance Goals**: Efficient async API, scalable to 1000+ req/s, low-latency (<200ms p95 typical)  
**Constraints**: All code in project/ directory, no frontend/mobile code, OpenAPI doc generation required, error and response patterns as specified, meta extensibility, pagination support, extensible meta in responses, strict error format, 4xx/5xx/422/validation error handling, developer-friendly structure  
**Scale/Scope**: Scaffold for backend API, extensible for future endpoints, models, and features

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (all API code in project/, tests in tests/)
- Using framework directly: Yes (actix-web, no unnecessary wrappers)
- Single data model: Yes (DTOs only if serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns: Yes (no Repository/UoW unless justified)

**Architecture**:
- Features as libraries: Yes (modular Rust crates/modules as needed)
- Libraries listed: actix-web (API), deadpool-postgres (DB pool), utoipa (OpenAPI), serde (serialization), validator (validation), thiserror (error types)
- CLI per library: N/A (API only)
- Library docs: Planned in quickstart.md and code comments

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor: Enforced (tests before implementation)
- Git commits: Tests precede implementation
- Order: Contract→Integration→Unit (OpenAPI contract, integration tests, then unit)
- Real dependencies: Yes (Postgres for integration tests)
- Integration tests: Yes (for endpoints, contract, and DB)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging: Planned (tracing/log crate)
- Frontend logs → backend: N/A (API only)
- Error context: Sufficient (error responses include code, message, description)

**Versioning**:
- Version number: To be assigned (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments: Planned for every change
- Breaking changes: To be handled with migration plan and parallel tests if needed

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
